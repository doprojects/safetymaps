            <h2>About Safety Maps.</h2>
            
            <p>
            Safety Maps is an online application you can use to make and share
            maps of safe places to meet in the event of a disaster or other
            emergency. You can share these maps with friends, or print them out
            in a variety of convenient sizes.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            All Safety Maps provide a space for you to include a personal
            message to the map’s recipients.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What’s the point?</h3>
            
            <p>
            There can be very little worse than being separated from those you
            care about most at a time of disaster. Energy you may literally
            need to survive will be consumed by the gnawing anxiety you will no
            doubt feel for them. What’s worse, coordinating via the
            conventional channels may be out of the question at such a moment:
            phone, text, and email networks may all be down.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Understanding this ahead of time, wouldn’t it be a step in the
            right direction if you were able to agree on a meeting place now —
            somewhere you all knew well, thought of as safe (or at least
            safer), and found easy to get to? And wouldn’t it be even better if
            you could print out a map of this place, to post in a prominent
            location or to keep with you at all times?
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Finally, wouldn’t it be wonderful if, in addition to its other
            provisions, that map had space for a personal note, something that
            let you feel the presence of someone who cares about you at what
            might be a very difficult moment?
            </p>
            
            <p>
            This is the challenge we set before ourselves in designing Safety
            Maps. We would love to hear your thoughts as to the kinds of things
            you use it for, and whether you think we’ve succeeded.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What kinds of emergencies can I use Safety Maps for?</h3>
            
            <p>
            San Franciscans and Tokyoites probably think primarily of
            earthquakes, New Yorkers have more experience with blackouts, and
            people from New Orleans are naturally concerned with flooding. We
            designed Safety Maps to be agnostic as to the kind of situation you
            use it for — it doesn’t even necessarily have to be a disaster.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            You can also print and share different maps for differing disaster
            scenarios: one meeting place for a fire, another for a flood, and
            so on. We’ve left space for you to give each unique map an
            appropriate and prominent title.
            </p>
            
            <h3>What is a “safe place”?</h3>
            
            <p>
            Wherever you think you, your friends and loved ones will be able to
            gather, be protected from further danger, and be easily visible to
            one another. We leave the definition of “safety” entirely up to
            you, although you can also see places other users nearby have
            chosen for these same qualities.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            We also strongly recommend checking with your local disaster
            preparedness office to confirm that the place you’ve chosen makes
            sense.
